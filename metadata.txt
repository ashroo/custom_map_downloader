about=Custom Map Downloader is a QGIS plugin that allows users to generate high-resolution, georeferenced GeoTIFF images from any loaded map layer. By providing a single latitude–longitude point, desired GSD (ground sampling distance), and output dimensions, the plugin automatically computes the correct map extent, renders the specified layer at the requested resolution, and exports a fully geotagged TIFF file. It supports satellite imagery, XYZ tiles, raster layers, and vector tile layers, making it ideal for simulation, training data generation, offline map extraction, and custom analysis workflows. Features include optional georeferencing toggle, automatic layer loading, progress feedback, and GDAL-based geospatial metadata.
